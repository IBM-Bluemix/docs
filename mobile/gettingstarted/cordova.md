# Getting started with the HelloWorld sample
{: #gettingstarted-cordova}

If you want to get started with a new Cordova application, you can use the HelloWorld app. This app demonstrates how to connect to your Bluemix backend from a mobile app without authentication. The app already has the SDK installed. When you're ready, you can get the specific libraries that you want to use in your app.

1. Create your mobile backend in Bluemix.
<ol>
	<li>In the Boilerplates section Bluemix catalog, click MobileFirst Services Starter.</li>
    	<li>Enter a name and host for your app and click **Create**.</li>
    	<li>Click **Finish**. </li>
</ol>
2. Get the project from GitHub. You can optionally use the git clone command to get the project. From your computer, open the terminal and then enter the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-samples-cordova-helloworld
```

3. Run the following commands from your project directory:

Android:
```
cordova platform add android
```

iOS:
```
cordova platform add ios
```

4. Add the Cordova plug-in with the following command:
```
cordova plugin add ibm-mfp-core
```

5. Configure your Cordova app

 * Android

	 Run the following commands from a command line to build and run your Android app:
	 ```
	 cordova build android
	 ```

	 ```
	 cordova run android
	 ```

	 An alert displays on your Android emulator or device.

	 **Important:** Before opening your project in Android Studio, first build your Cordova application through the Cordova command-line interface (CLI) to avoid build errors.

 * iOS

    1. Use the most recent version of Xcode to open your xcode.proj file in the &lt;app_name&gt;/platforms/ios directory.

		**Important:** If you receive a message to "Convert to Latest Swift Syntax", click Cancel.

	2. Go to **Build Settings > Swift Compiler - Code Generation > Objective-C Bridging Header** and add the following path:

	```
	<your_project_name>/Plugins/ibm-mfp-core/Bridging-Header.h
	```
	3. Go to **Build settings > Linking > Runpath Search Paths** and add the following Frameworks parameter:

	```
	@executable_path/Frameworks
	```
	4. Build and run your application with Xcode.


6. Configure the HelloWorld sample
<ol>
	<li>Change to the directory where you cloned the project</li>
	<li>Open the &lt;your_app_dir&gt;/www/js/index.js file and replace the &lt;APPLICATION_ROUTE&gt; and &lt;APPLICATION_ID&gt; with your Bluemix application ID and route values.</li>
</ol>

Note: Make sure that your &lt;APPLICATION_ROUTE&gt; is securely using the https protocol.

Javascript:
```
// Bluemix credentials
route: "<APPLICATION_ROUTE>",
GUID: "<APPLICATION_GUID>",
```

7. Run the sample on your mobile emulator or device.

   Build the Cordova app using the following commands:
  	```
		cordova build ios
		```
    ```
		cordova build android
		```

   Run the sample app using the following commands:
	 ```
	 cordova run ios
	 ```
   ```
	 cordova run android
	 ```


A single view application with a **PING BLUEMIX** button displays. When you tap the button, the application tests the connection from the client to the backend Bluemix application. The connection is tested by using the Application Route that you specify in the index.js file.

When you successfully connect to Bluemix from the mobile app, a message that says "Yay! You are connected" displays.
8. Resolve any problems.

<!--![Hello World application not connected to Bluemix](images/bummer_android.jpg "Figure 2. Hello World application not connected to Bluemix")-->

If the connection fails, a message: "Bummer Something went wrong" displays. More information about the error is included.
Check the following items:
 * Verify that you correctly pasted the route and GUID values.
 * View the Xcode or Android debug log.
 * Check the status of your app in Bluemix.
