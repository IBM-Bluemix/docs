With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, you can protect your most sensitive workloads behind your company firewall, while staying securely connected and in sync with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public. 
{:shortdesc}

IBMÂ® uses cloud operations as a service to monitor and maintain your environment, so that you can focus on building apps and services that run on top of the environment. IBM also handles platform updates, so that you can focus on the business.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local includes a private, syndicated catalog that displays the local services that are available exclusively to you. It also includes additional services that are syndicated from and available for you to use from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local sits on a virtual machine that is behind your company firewall, so that you have the highest performing and most secure cloud infrastructure available to you. IBM installs, remotely monitors, and manages {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local in your data center through IBM's relay technology.

Relay is a delivery capability included with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local that enables IBM to automatically and consistently deliver updates to all local deployments, so that you always have an up-to-date, stable, and secure system. Relay achieves secure connectivity through an open, outbound SSL, VPN tunnel that originates from the inception virtual machine using certificates that are specific to each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local instance. The traffic on this tunnel is Urban Code Deployer automation for serving and maintaining the platform, compute resources, and services for your instance.

##{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local infrastructure requirements
{: #localinfra}

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local, you own the physical security and the infrastructure for hosting the local instance. IBM sets the following requirements for setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local.
###Hardware
While there are requirements for the type and size of available hardware, you can choose any combination to meet the set resource total requirements.
<dl>
<dt>**VMware ESXi hardware**</dt>
<dd>
ESXi is a virtualization layer that runs on physical servers and that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and resources into multiple virtual machines. Choose any combination that meets the following resource totals, on the condition that minimum physical core count per ESXi is eight. The following specifications are for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} core runtime only.
<ul>
<li>48 Physical cores at 2.0 of more GHz each</li>
<li>756 GB of physical RAM</li>
</li>Total datastore size of 7.5 TB 
<ul>
<li>7 TB datastore to hold {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}</li>
<li>500 GB datastore to hold the inception virtual machine</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use multiple datastores, use the same prefix for each.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**High availability**</dt>
<dd>
To support a single node failure, you must have n+1 ESXi. For example, if two ESXis are used, meaning 16x cores each, then a third is needed.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The customer VMware administrator can decide to enforce strict high availability failover in the cluster to guarantee resources.</p>
</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>
Recommended requirements include a customer accessible port group with 10 customer network IP addresses that have outbound internet access. Then, define a second private VLAN between only the ESXis being used for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local. This VLAN is shown as a port group in VMware. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local uses it for the private subnet, which is more secure and can help avoid routing issues.
</dd>
</dl>

###vCenter server configuration
Review the following version, datacenter, resource pool, and datastore requirements.
<dl>
<dt>**Supported VMware versions**</dt>
<dd>vCenter and ESXi 5.1 and 5.5</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create a datacenter, if one does not exist.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter folder**</dt>
<dd>Create a VM folder with the same name as the cluster, if you do not plan to grant Administrator access that is propagated from the datacenter.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Create a cluster specifically for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local use. An example for the cluster name is `bluemix`.</dd>
<dt>**Resource pool**</dt>
<dd>Create a resource pool under the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local cluster. An example for resource pool name is `local`.</dd>
</dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Requires 7.5 TB for the initial deployment of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.<br />
<br />
**Note**: When you use more than one datastore, ensure that each one begins with the same prefix. Examples of multiple datastore names with the same prefix are `bluemix_datastore_01` and `bluemix_datastore_02`.</dd>
</dl>

###Network Bandwidth
Recommended throughput is 5 Mbps up and 5 Mbps down, and you can expect a monthly data usage of 10 GB. IBM establishes agreed upon windows when large bundles of data are delivered, which can be as large as 3 GB.
###VMware permissions
Set the following roles and permissions. Propagation is set for each permission. If the permission is propagated, the permission gets passed down through the object hierarchy. However, permissions for a child object always override permissions that are propagated from a parent object.
<dl>
<dt>**v Center Server**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as read-only and not propagated.<br />
<br />
**Note**: This role is needed to retrieve task status for specific disk operations.</dd>
<dt>**Datacenter**</dt>
<dd>Create the role "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}" and grant permissions for **Datastore** including **Low level file operations** and **Update virtual machine files**.<br />
<br />
**Note**: This role is needed to support file posts to the datastores.</dd>
<dt>**Cluster**</dt>
<dd>Set the role as administrator and propagated.</dd>
<dt>**Datastores**</dt>
<dd>Set the role administrator and propagated for each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} datastore.</dd>
<dt>**Network**</dt>
<dd>Set public and private port groups with the administrator role, not propagated.</dd>
</dl>

###Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) pool
Each DEA is configured with:
- 16 - 32 GB of RAM
- 2x - 4x vCPU
- 150 - 300 GB of storage

For example, if the ESXi host size is 256 GB of memory with 16x cores, then eight DEAs are added. If the ESXi host size is 64 GB of memory with 8x cores, then two ESXis and four DEAs are required to be added. An additional 1.5 TB of storage is required for every four DEAs. This example is based on a DEA configured with 32 GB of RAM, 4x vCPU, and 300 GB of storage.

##Maintaining your local instance
{: #maintainlocal}

IBM maintains and installs updates and fixes as IBM deems appropriate to the Bluemix Local platform, runtimes, and services. Services might not be available during maintenance windows.

**Important**: IBM reserves the right to interrupt services to apply emergency maintenance as needed. IBM might change scheduled maintenance hours, but notifies you of any such changes, as well as any emergency maintenance information.

The following types of maintenance are required for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local:
<dl>
<dt>**Standard Maintenance Windows**</dt>
<dd>The services utilize pre-defined, standard maintenance windows, which might cause the services to be unavailable. IBM does not require customer approval to perform maintenance, but attempts to minimize impact to your services.<br />
<br />
IBM sends broadcast messages of the changes that are planned for each maintenance window, through email, phone, or other methods.<br />
<br />
**Important**: Some service might not be available to you during the maintenance period.</dd>

<dt>**Monthly Change Window**</dt>
<dd>The monthly maintenance window is applied based on coordination between you and IBM within a 21-day window. You can provide IBM with specific dates or times within the 21-day window that might not work for you. IBM attempts to schedule updates around those times. Based on the requests, IBM communicates the scheduled maintenance window to you. Monthly change windows are not expected to impact the running Bluemix Local environment.<br />
<br />
**Note**: If you do not request a specific time for the update, the maintenance is automatically applied at the end of the window.<br />
<br />
Go to **ADMINISTRATION > SYSTEM INFORMATION** to view pending updates, set unavailable dates, and approve updates. For more information about notifications and scheduling pending updates, see <a href="../admin/index.html#oc_system">Viewing system information</a>.</dd>

<dt>**Other**</dt>
<dd>IBM intends to confine all maintenance that might affect your services, in particular the availability of your Bluemix Local environment, runtimes, and services, to the standard and monthly windows. Other change windows might be used on an exception basis for management of the environment. IBM makes reasonable efforts to minimize the impact to you during such change windows and notifies you in advance.</dd>
</dl>

To set up maintenance of your local instance, work with your IBM designated account representative to identify an agreed upon window for the standard maintenance.

##Restoring your local instance
{: #restorelocal}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Local settings and configurations are backed up regularly to prepare for any unplanned outages in the environment.

As part of the backup of your data, IBM completes the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Encrypts all backup copies and manages encryption keys</li>
<li>Monitors and manages backup activity</li>
<li>Provides the encrypted backup files</li>
<li>Restores the requested data</li>
<li>Manages scheduling conflicts between backup and fix management operations</li>
</ul>

Because protection of private data is critical, IBM needs your collaboration when dealing with backup file management, so that the files are not moved outside of your data centers. Specifically, IBM asks that you complete the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Move a copy of your encrypted backup data off-site, just as you would for any other backup data that you manage.</li>
<li>Provide the backup files for the IBM operator in case of any need to restore.</li>
</ul>
