# Deploying {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} applications to the cloud
{: #t_deploytocloud}

You can deploy your {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} applications to a {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} instance that is running in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} cloud.
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} applications are written in {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Processing Language (SPL), SPL, Java, Scala, or Python in an {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} environment. You can now develop Streams Python applications without an {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} environment. See [Deploying {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Python applications to the cloud](docs/services/StreamingAnalytics/t_deploytocloud.html#t_deploypython)


{{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} doesn't include an {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} development environment in the cloud, but you can deploy the applications that you develop locally to the cloud.

Before you begin, disable the pop-up blocker of your browser to display the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} console.

To deploy your {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} applications to the cloud:

1. Set up your development environment to develop and test your application.

	If you want to use an {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} environment, you can download the {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Quick Start Edition, free-of-charge. Go to the [IBM Streams product page](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/stream-computing/){:new_window} and click **Download the native software installation**.

2. Develop your streaming application in your development environment. In {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} development environment, you can use Streams Studio or the command-line tools to develop your application.

3. Verify that your streaming application runs properly in your development environment.
**Note:** You must compile your application in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.5 operating system or an equivalent CentOS version, using Intel processors.

4. Submit the application bundle (.sab file) that is associated with your SPL, Java, Scala or Python application to your service instance in the cloud by using one of these methods:
	* Use the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} console to submit the application bundle.
  * Create a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} application and add the {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} application to it. Control it by using the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} REST API.

Your application is now deployed in the cloud. You can monitor your application using the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service. You can also submit more than one application (.sab files) to your service instance. As many as you want.

{{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} also supports several Javaâ„¢ development kits that you can use to develop your applications. For more information about the Java support in {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}}, see [Supported Java development kits for application development](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCRJU_4.2.0/com.ibm.streams.install.doc/doc/ibminfospherestreams-install-prerequisites-java-supported-sdks.html){:new_window}.

## Deploying {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Python applications to the cloud
{: #t_deploypython}

Deploy your {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Python applications to a {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service that is running in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} cloud. You do not need to have an {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} installation.

[{{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Python Application API](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/python-appapi-devguide/#50-api-features), which is included in the streamsx package, enables you to deploy Python applications to the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service. Check out the [Developing for the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.documentation/docs/python/1.6/python-appapi-devguide-2a/index.html) tutorial to get an example of how to create and deploy a simple Python application for the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service.

IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) also supports the submission of Python applications in Jupyter interactive notebooks. For more information, see [Developing Python applications for {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}}](/docs/services/StreamingAnalytics/t_develop_apps_python.html).
