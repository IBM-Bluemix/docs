User ID-based {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} are targeted at mobile app users with customized messages. With user-based notifications, you can choose to notify specific individuals based on their preferences.

## Register device with User ID
To enable push notifications targeted by User ID, ensure that you register the device with a User ID field set.   

The User ID can be any string that the application provides to the device registration API. Typically, a mobile application will first run an authentication cycle where the mobile app user is authenticated against an authentication service such as [{{site.data.keyword.amafull}}](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobileaccess/index.html). On successful authentication, the authenticated user ID is then passed into the Push Device Registration API.  

## Synchronizing user login and logout 

You can choose to send notifications only if the user is logged in. 

For example, if a device is shared by a family or shared by a team at work, and you need to address specific users in the family or team. In such a use case, there would be a user log-in and log out sequence. This authentication mechanism allows the application to track the identity of the present user of the application. This ensures that notifications targeted to a specific user are always received by that user only. After a successful log-in, invoke the device registration API passing the User ID of the logged-in user. Likewise, before logging out, invoke the device unregistration API. Sequencing these Push APIs with log-in and log out will ensure that push notifications that are meant for a specific user are sent to that user only.
