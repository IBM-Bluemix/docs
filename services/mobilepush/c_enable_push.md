# Enabling notifications for mobile devices
{: #c_enable_push-notifications}
Last updated: 06 December 2016

You can enable applications to send push notifications to your mobile devices.

This section describes how to enable your client applications - mobile, web browser applications and also Chrome Apps and Extensions to receive push notifications, how to create basic notifications, get and initialize the SDK or plug-in, and how to register your device or browser to receive push notifications. You can also enable your mobile and web browser applications to receive push notifications by using the [REST API](t_restapi.html).

Note: For device, browser, Chrome Apps and Extensions registrations, the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service maintains a unique reference to tokens issued from notification providers -
APNs for Apple or FCM for Google. The tokens can be invalidated by the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service notification provider for several reasons. 

For example, during uninstalling an app on the device. In such a scenario, when a notification is attempted to be delivered based on the providers response that the device is invalidated, the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service will remove the device or web browser registrations. This in turn would restrain consequent attempts in sending notification to those invalidated devices.
