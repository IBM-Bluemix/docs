# Tag-based Notifications

Last updated: 06 December 2016

Tag-based notification messages are targeted to all the devices that are subscribed to a particular tag. You can define tags and then send and receive messages using tags. 

You must first create the tags for the application, set up the tag subscriptions and then initiate the tag-based notifications. To send a Tag-based notification using the [REST API](https://mobile.{DomainName}/imfpush/), ensure that the "tagNames" are provided when posting to the message resource.
