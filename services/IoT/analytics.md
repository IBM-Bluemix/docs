Use Watson {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} analytics to get the analytical information that you need from the raw data that your devices produce.  
{: shortdesc}

By using boards and cards, you can view graphics that represent data set values from one or more devices for a quick overview and understanding of the device data.

With analytics rules, you specify the conditions that trigger actions. For example, you might create a rule to ensure that an alert is sent to the dashboard on a user's device, and that an email is sent to the administrator, when the device is dropped, or when the temperature of the device spikes.

Use cloud rules to trigger rules for devices that are connected directly to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} in the cloud, and edge rules to trigger rules for devices that are connected to edge analytics-enabled gateways.
